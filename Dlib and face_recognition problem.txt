pip install dlib and pip install face_recognition might not work even with pip3 on windows.
Official GitHub says it is supported on Linux and macOS and on windows it might work.
Corresponding conda install is expected to work. It will install in its own environment.

Note that here the installation will fail because pip fail to detect the dlib conda installed earlier
Therefor run

pip install --no-dependencies face_recognition this worked.

Always update first,
conda install numpy
conda install scipy
conda install dlib
