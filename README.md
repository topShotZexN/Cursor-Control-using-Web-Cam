# Cursor-Control-using-Web-Cam
HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION PROJECT

Abstract: This HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) application in Python 3 will allow authorized users to control mouse cursor with facial movements, works by accessing the system’s webcam when the application is run. Automatic facial expression recognition has become a progressive research area since it plays a major role in human-computer-interaction. The facial expression recognition finds major application in areas like social interaction and social intelligence. This project is deeply centered around predicting the facial landmarks of a given known face. By identifying the facial features, this tool also prints out all the possible people’s names which are stored in the datasets. It implements the concept of supervised learning which is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. We can accomplish a lot of things using these landmarks, from detecting eye-blinks (squint) in a video to predicting emotions of the subject. The applications, outcomes, and possibilities of facial landmarks are immense and intriguing. In this project, these actions are programmed as triggers to control the mouse cursor.
